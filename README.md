# Introduction
The sago•fonto® HEPWAT software project forms an open source framework for a data and digitalization platform, providing tools for collecting, processing and storing large amounts of data from a multitude of data sources. 

This framework also provides rest-based services offering realtime and historic data to 3rd party systems.

sago•fonto® HEPWAT is designed having a scalable architecture for IoT and Big Data in mind and requires a Linux based platform with Node-RED, Kafka, MongoDB and PostGreSQl installed.
